           <strong>The Definition of swimming:</strong> the sport or activity of propelling oneself through water using the limbs.
           <strong>The History Of Swimming:</strong> Swimming emerged as a competitive recreational activity in the 1830s in England.
           In 1828, the first indoor swimming pool, St George's Baths was opened to the public.
           By 1837, the National Swimming Society was holding regular swimming competitions in six artificial swimming pools, built around London.
