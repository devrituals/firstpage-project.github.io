          <center> <strong>The Definition of swimming:</strong></center></p>
     <p>
            <strong>Swimming</strong> is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to move through water. The sport takes place in pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). Competitive <strong>swimming</strong> is one of the most popular <strong>Olympic sports</strong>, with varied distance events in <strong>butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle</strong>, and <strong>individual medley</strong>. In addition to these individual events, four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay. A medley relay consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle.
       <strong>Swimming</strong> each stroke requires a set of specific techniques; in competition, there are distinct regulations concerning the acceptable form for each individual stroke. There are also regulations on what types of swimsuits, caps, jewelry and injury tape that are allowed at competitions. Although it is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries from the sport, such as tendinitis in the shoulders or knees, there are also <strong>multiple health benefits</strong> associated with the sport.

            <center><strong>The History Of Swimming:</strong></center>  </p>
     <p>
       
       <strong>Swimming</strong> emerged as a competitive recreational activity in the 1830s in England.
            In 1828, the first indoor <strong>swimming</strong> pool, St George's Baths was opened to the public.
            By 1837, the National <strong>Swimming</strong> Society was holding regular <strong>swimming</strong> competitions in six artificial <strong>swimming</strong> pools, built around London.
        
       Evidence of recreational <strong>swimming</strong> in prehistoric times has been found, with the earliest evidence dating to Stone Age paintings from around 10,000 years ago. Written references date from 2000 BC, with some of the earliest references to swimming including the <strong>Iliad</strong>, the <strong>Odyssey</strong>, the <strong>Bible</strong>, <strong>Beowulf</strong>, the <strong>Quran</strong> and others. In 1538, Nikolaus Wynmann, a Swiss–German professor of languages, wrote the earliest known complete book about <strong>swimming</strong>, Colymbetes, sive de arte natandi dialogus et festivus et iucundus lectu (The Swimmer, or A Dialogue on the Art of Swimming and Joyful and Pleasant to Read).[5]

The recreational activity grew in popularity and by 1880, when the first national governing body, the Amateur Swimming Association was formed, there were already over 300 regional clubs in operation across the country.
